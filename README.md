## What is this software?

This is a Winamp5 input plug-in for the following music driver song data used in the NEC PC-98x1 series.

* FMP(.OVI .OPI .OZI)
* PMD(.M .M2 .MS .MP .MZ)


## How to install

Copy in_fmpmd.dll to your Winamp plugin folder.
Copy WinFMP.dll and PMDWin.dll to the path or the same location as Winamp.exe.


## Required Environment

* [Winamp](https://www.winamp.com) Ver. 5.3 or later
* OPNA rhythm sound file (2608_*.WAV)
* [WinFMP.dll](http://c60.la.coocan.jp/download.html) ver0.03 or later

## Specification

FMP comments are often optimized for 80 characters x 3 lines on a PC-98 screen. Remove overlapping (full/half-width) spaces & tabs because they are too wasteful to display one line in Winamp.
